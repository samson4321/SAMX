# Test File (TST)

## Purpose
This file documents the tests performed to verify the correctness and reliability of the machine learning pipeline implemented in this project.

---

## Test Environment
- Python 3.x
- Libraries installed via `requirements.txt`
- Execution environment: Anaconda / Jupyter Notebook

---

## Tests Performed

### 1. Data Loading Test
**Description:**  
Verified that the dataset loads correctly from the CSV file.

**Expected Result:**  
Dataset loads without errors and displays correct shape and column names.

**Outcome:**  
Passed – dataset loaded successfully.

---

### 2. Data Preprocessing Test
**Description:**  
Checked removal of non-informative columns (`signal_id`) and handling of numeric features.

**Expected Result:**  
Only numeric features remain for model training.

**Outcome:**  
Passed – preprocessing completed correctly.

---

### 3. Feature–Target Split Test
**Description:**  
Verified correct separation of features (`X`) and target variable (`y`).

**Expected Result:**  
`X` excludes the `class` column; `y` contains only class labels.

**Outcome:**  
Passed.

---

### 4. Model Training Test
**Description:**  
Trained baseline SVM and Random Forest models.

**Expected Result:**  
Models train without runtime errors.

**Outcome:**  
Passed.

---

### 5. Hyperparameter Optimization Test
**Description:**  
Applied Bayesian Optimization to tune SVM and Random Forest hyperparameters.

**Expected Result:**  
Best parameter sets are identified and returned.

**Outcome:**  
Passed – optimal parameters obtained.

---

### 6. Model Evaluation Test
**Description:**  
Evaluated models using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

**Expected Result:**  
Metrics are computed correctly and confusion matrices are generated.

**Outcome:**  
Passed.

---

### 7. Visualization Test
**Description:**  
Generated confusion matrix heatmaps and performance comparison plots.

**Expected Result:**  
Plots display correctly with appropriate labels.

**Outcome:**  
Passed.

---

## Conclusion
All components of the pipeline were tested successfully, and the system performs as expected.
